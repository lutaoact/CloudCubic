## Table of content is generated using python markdown

- Install it by:

`pip install markdown`

- Add [TOC] to the top of help.md

- run

`python -m markdown -x toc help.md > help.html` 

Unfortunately, generated html file doesn't contain html tag and head and body etc. So I add them by hand.

## Change log

add the html tag in markdown file, thus it will generate the html tags.

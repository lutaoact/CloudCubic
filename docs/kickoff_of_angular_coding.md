This document lists all the 3rd techknowledges for angular that we use in the project.  
Feel free to add or update stuff here.  
The recommended format will be:  
```
+ [some module](someUrl)  
summary
  + xxx
  + xxx
tips:some tips
  + xxx
  + xxx
```

+ [ui.router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router)  
The uiRouter can do everything that ngRouter can do. And can do something plus.  
[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21023763/difference-between-angular-route-and-angular-ui-router) is the comparison between these two.  
  + [nested view](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Nested-States-%26-Nested-Views)
